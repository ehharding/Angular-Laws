# Reporting Vulnerabilities In Pocket Fic

Pocket Fic is still very much WiP. However, there are plans to integrate security checks with the main CI/CD pipeline on GitHub. I would also like to include a suite of
security tools, linting and otherwise, that would assist with security best practices while developing. While no user data is stored on the site yet, with their being no
backend system, I would still like to be security conscious while developing the site and overall architecture.

Please email reports about any security related issues you find to `ehharding@gmail.com`. Please use a descriptive subject line for your report email. In addition, please
include the following information along with your report:

* Your name and affiliation (if any).
* A description of the technical details of the vulnerability(ies). It is very important to communicate how to reproduce the issue.
* An explanation of who can exploit the vulnerability(ies), and what they gain when doing so -- write an attack scenario. This will help with
  evaluating the report more quickly, especially if the issue is of a more complex nature.
* Whether the vulnerability(ies) is(are) public or known to third parties. If so, please provide details.
