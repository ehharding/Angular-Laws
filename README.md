## Executive Summary
A Modern FanFiction Website For The Modern Web... at least that's my goal! I don't see any super nice-looking or user-friendly fan fiction websites
out there, and I honestly want one. So, I'm building one... starting with the front-end design and hopefully later on with the back-end. I'm doing
this to gain some architecture and general full-stack experience along with knowledge in various modern toolkits and programming paradigms (outside my
main job, of course).
