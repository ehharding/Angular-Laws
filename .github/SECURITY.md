# Reporting Vulnerabilities In Angular Laws

Angular Laws is still much WiP. However, plans exist to integrate security checks with the main CI/CD pipeline on GitHub. I would also like to include a suite of security
tools, linting and otherwise, that would help with security best practices while developing.

Please email reports about any security related issues you find to `ehharding@gmail.com`. Please use a descriptive subject line for your report email. Also, please include the
following information along with your report:

* Your name and affiliation (if any).
* A description of the technical details of the vulnerability(ies). It is important to communicate how to reproduce the issue.
* An explanation of who can exploit the vulnerability(ies), and what they gain when doing so -- write an attack scenario. This will help with evaluating the report more
  quickly, especially if the issue is of a more complex nature.
* Whether the vulnerability(ies) is(are) public or known to third parties. If so, please provide details.
